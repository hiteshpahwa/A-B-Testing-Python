In collaboration with adventure park, I conducted an A/B test on their game "Super Lobster Run" to assess user behavior based on different starting levels. The experiment randomly assigned new users to start either at the "Gulf of Maine" or "North Atlantic" level. Firstly, I analyzed user spending distribution using histograms, with one depicting user spending and another incorporating version as a color variable. Subsequently, a statistical test was performed to verify if user spending followed a normal distribution, with the null hypothesis being that it does. The test revealed a p-value that suggests non-normal distribution. Following this, I conducted a statistical test to assess the impact of the version on user spending, with the null hypothesis stating no significant difference. The results provided evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant impact of the version on user spending. Additionally, I analyzed retention rates for both versions at one and seven days without statistical tests, observing apparent differences. However, binomial z-tests were employed to compare retention_1 and retention_7 between the two versions. The null hypothesis for both tests was that there's no difference in retention rates between versions. Based on the tests, conclusions were drawn regarding retention_1 and retention_7 for each version. Finally, I provided recommendations for Lobster Land based on the findings, suggesting further investigation into factors influencing user behavior and retention. Additionally, I highlighted the importance of contextual information in interpreting the results effectively.![image](https://github.com/hiteshpahwa/A-B-Testing-Python/assets/163701088/780ba50e-c14a-4e0d-80aa-eefc8048977d)
